This was the first mock website I ever built.  It was part of the Scrimba "Responsive Web Design" Bootcamp, taught by Kevin Powell.

It's the first project that involved multiple pages, modifier classes, and file path management.  We also focused on typography quite a bit, as a major part of the lesson was to manage consistency across several pages.  This involved settings up the various header tags and images to follow certain parameters, no matter which section of the website the user is currently viewing.  We also did a small unit on psuedo elements, which I find particularly interesting and fun to work with.

This project was a blast to work on!  I love Kevin's teaching style and I just so happen to love the Blues Brothers and comedy films in general.  I was happy to see that we included jokes and nods to the movie, rather than typical Lorem Ipsum placeholder text.
